## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encountering an error with downloading `dlib`, you will need to download CMake and ensure it's added to your environmental path (there's a setting for this during installation).

Additionally, download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file from the following link:
